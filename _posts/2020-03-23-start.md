excerpt: The first post for this blog!

To my future self:

Welcome back to the first post of my blog!

So, as you should recall, I created this blog for you, to look back and see what we did, how we did it, and perhaps get a nice boost to your encourage to carry on doing work. It was supposed to be, like, a digital version of looking back on those exercise book games when we were younger and bursting full of motivation (and boredom).

And since at this time, that is when this version of the website was finally created, and I had more time and was planning to get back to work on making more side projects (get those creaky brain wheels running and all). So let's see how far this one went!

Good luck future me.
