excerpt: Starting work on my first simple mobile game!
---

To my future self:

Today was when I decided to start work on my first simple mobile game! Hopefully this actually finishes...

Basically, I realized that
1. My portfolio didn't really have any recent games (except game jam games)
2. I can't exactly say I have an idea how to publish a mobile game now, considering the last time I did it was... 5 years ago.

So I decided that I would try to make something quick, with the main intention being 
1. To understand the full process from starting a game project to getting it out on the store
2. To get my game-making gears re-running (hopefully). 

It didn't have to be super fun, it just has to... exist. If I don't get something out there, I'll never start, after all.

Therefore, the game I'm going to try making is a mobile (android) game where balls fall and you tap on them to prevent them from hitting the ground and gain points.
That's all.
As simple as possible.
Get the main gameplay done as fast as possible so that I can work on releasing and polish.

At this point, I'll be using Unity 2D to start with. If this works out well, I might try to 
1. Make the entire system run on ECS, since I never tried ECS before.
2. Redo the entire thing in UE4, since I never did UE4 mobile development before (or 2D, even).

Future me, I hope I managed to get this thing out.
