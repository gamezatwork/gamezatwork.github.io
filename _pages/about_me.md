## Biography
After touching Macromedia Flash for the first time when I was young, I have been entranced by the idea of creating games, and always wanted to join the game industry as a Game Developer. This was pushed further by the various multiplayer games I played with my family such as Bomberman, Puzzle Bubble, and other JRPGs such as Chrono Trigger, the Final Fantasy series, and the Megaman Battle Network series.  

Upon finishing my High School education, I went to take a Diploma in Game Design and Development, followed by a Bachelors of Science in Game Design. Through them, I managed to learn alot for both Game Design (such as Level Design, Game Feel, and more) and Game Programming (including Vector Calculus, Programming Patterns, AI and Networking), and got to put them into practice through the various game projects we had to work on, some of which even involving the creation of our own game engines!  

After graduating, I joined Bandai Namco Studios Singapore as a Game Designer, and later a Technical Designer, getting a chance to use both my design side and technical side to the fullest. I was able to learn a lot from all my talented colleagues, especially since I was given a chance to work with every department here at some point in time!

The main games that inspire me for game creation are games such as Bomberman and the Raving Rabbids series, where family members can gather around a console and have fun playing together no matter their skill level, as I feel that games serve as a great tool to bringing people together, and being unfamiliar with games shouldn't serve as a barrier of entry!
