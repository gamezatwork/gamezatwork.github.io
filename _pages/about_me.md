## Biography
Hey there! I'm Wesley, currently a Technical Designer in Bandai Namco Studios Singapore.  
After touching Macromedia Flash for the first time when I was young, I have been entranced by the idea of creating games, and always wanted to join the game industry as a Game Developer. This was pushed further by the various multiplayer games I played with my family such as Bomberman, Puzzle Bubble, and other JRPGs such as Chrono Trigger, the Final Fantasy series, and the Megaman Battle Network series.  
Upon finishing my High School education, I went to take a Diploma in Game Design and Development in Singapore Polytechnic, which allowed me to grow greatly as a developer through their various projects (involving actually creating a playable game) and exposure to members in the game industry. This is where I finally discovered my liking for doing both Game Design and Game Programming, something I was decently competent at.  
Finally, I went to take a Bachelors of Science in Game Design at DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore, which gave me even more experiences through the game projects and lessons in both Game Design (such as Level Design, Game Feel, and more) and Programming (including Vector Calculus, Programming Patterns, AI and Networking). We even had multiple projects which involved created a game engine in C++ from scratch, which helped me get an in-depth glimpse as to how game engines function underneath. For example, I managed to create a 2D graphics library, a Behaviour Tree system, and even game editors, all of which were really fun and exciting to learn!  
Until now, I still enjoy making games, and try to take part in Game Jams whenever possible, especially the Global Game Jam. My main tools are Unity and Unreal Engine 4, although I am quite capable of quickly picking up any new engines introduced to me. I am also familiar with creating physical games such as board games and card games.  
As for the programming side, due to my education, I managed to get a chance to dabble with being a 2D Graphics Programmer and AI programmer, although my main specialty is Gameplay Programming (which I still do in my current job), and my main passion is Tools Creation, which I did multiple times during my education.  
The main games that inspire me for game creation are games such as Bomberman and the Raving Rabbids series, where family members can gather around a console and have fun playing together no matter their skill level, as I feel that games serve as a great tool to bringing people together, and being unfamiliar with games shouldn't serve as a barrier of entry!
