project_description: |
  This project was commissioned as part of a research project regarding the effects of In-game purchases and screen size.  
  Two versions of the game were made, where one had a cash shop, in which players could use "real-world money" (simulated using a limited supply of virtual money separate from the gold obtained within the game) to purchase new units, get large amounts of gold, or extra items.  
  The game was also made for both the iPhone and iPad, in order to test out the effects of screen size.  
  The research paper, "Flow and Mobile Gaming: The Effects of In-Game Purchases and Screen Size", was presented at the ICA Conference 2016 in Fukuoka.
