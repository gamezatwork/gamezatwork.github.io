project_summary: A HTC Vive arcade game, inspired by an old game series called "Megaman Battle Network", where you fight in an arena against waves of enemies,  picking up new weapons as you go while being restricted to your own area.
project_description: |
  This project was created as part of a school module where we had to make VR games. My objective was to create a game for the HTC Vive where I could let players feel like they are fighting with cool weapons against enemies in an arena, while actually being constrained to one space (similar to Tennis and Badminton).  
  I decided to take inspiration from an old game series (Megaman Battle Network), where players have to fight enemies in real-time on a grid-like battle field while being restrained to their own space.
  The graphical assets were not done by me, but by my talented friends Wong Yu Ping and Tham Hui Yee.
  In this game, you have 3 weapons, which can be used on either one of your hands.
  * Buster - Press the trigger to shoot, hold and release to fire a more powerful shot which will explode in an area.
  * Sword - Hold the trigger to activate the sword, swing it while activated to damage enemies that you cut through.
  * Shield - Blocks enemy shots while held in front of you. Hold the trigger and swing it at a direction to throw it like a boomerang.
job_details: 
- Designed and created the main mechanic.
- Designed and implemented all the weapons
- Implemented the enemy AI.
- Designed the level.
