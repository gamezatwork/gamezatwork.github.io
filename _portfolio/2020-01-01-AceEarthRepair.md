project_description: |
  This project was created as an entry to the Global Game Jam 2020 under the theme of "Repair", and had to be made within 48 hours. All assets, from graphics, to sounds, to scripts, were created from scratch within that time.  
  All the art and sound (including the BGM) was created by Hu Xinjie, and the shooting part was implemented by Raimi, and we all didn't know each other until the game jam began, so this was the first time for all of us working together.
job_details: 
- Implemented the "Core" coordinate system; A 2D coordinate system which is mapped to rings around the core.
- Implemented the "Core" mechanic of objects molding themselves onto where they hit the core.
- Implemented the UI for the game
