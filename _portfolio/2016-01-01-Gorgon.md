project_description: |
  This project was created as part of a school module where we had to make VR games. My objective was to create a game for the Oculus Rift without using any external controllers, so that players can play it using only the Oculus Rift without any external devices.  
  Note that most of the graphical assets were not done by me, but rather taken from the Unity Asset Store (although they are free).
job_details: 
- Designed and created the main mechanic.
- Implemented the enemy AI.
- Designed the level.
