project_summary: I Will End This Nightmare is a 3D 3rd Person Action Platformer where you play as a girl trapped in the dream world. In order to escape, you must make use of your ability to cast spells by playing notes in the correct order, and ring all of the bells in the level, without getting defeated by the nightmares in the world.
project_description: This project was created for a 6 month long school project. We managed to make our own custom engine using OpenGL and C++, along with our own Level Editor and Behaviour Tree Editor using wxWidgets.
job_details: ['Created a level editor using wxWidgets for the team to use to create, save, and load levels, along with creating objects in the world and modifying them.', 'Created a Behaviour Tree editor using wxWidgets for the team to use, which was used to create cutscenes, enemy behaviours, and gameplay elements.', 'Designed all enemies in the game, along with the miniboss and boss.', ' Implemented most of the enemies in the game, including the miniboss and boss.', 'Implemented Flocking behaviour, and added extra modifications to it to allow it to have a leader in the flock, and not to merge with other flocks. (This was used for one of the main enemies in our game)', 'Implemented the "song" system (in which players chain together a set of keys to cause attacks to happen)']
