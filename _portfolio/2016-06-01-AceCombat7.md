project_short_summary: "Was part of the multiplayer team in Bandai Namco Studios Singapore for the AAA console title Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, which released in 2019 on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC."
project_summary: |
  Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown was the long-awaited latest entry in the Ace Combat series, released in 2019 on the PS4, XBox One, and PC (via Steam). It was created in Unreal Engine 4, and received generally favorable reviews, with the physical console versions setting a new sales record in the series in the United Kingdom.  
  For the multiplayer component, which I worked on, there are 2 main modes; Team Deathmatch and Battle Royal. For each of the modes, there are 6 maps, each with different settings, cloud formations, and overall gameplay.
