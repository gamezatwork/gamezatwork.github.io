project_description: This project was created as an entry to the DBS Game Jam 2015 under the theme of The Bears and the Bulls, and had to be made within 3 days. All assets, from graphics, to sounds, to scripts, were created from scratch within that time. We were able to win the Grand Prize amongst more than 40 other competitors from other Singapore schools nationwide. More details can be found at the official website link below.
job_details: 
- Set up the schedule and workflow for the entire team, including soft milestones, progress updates, and scoping.
- Implemented the main mechanic of controlling and moving the bulls, along with the ability to interact with objects such as the Turrets and the Walls.
- Set up a system and workflow which allowed the game designers to balance the stats of the game using Google Sheets and no code. This included details about the waves, and each individual bull's information.
