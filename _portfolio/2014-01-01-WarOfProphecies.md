project_summary: War of Prophecies is a 2D multiplayer turn-based strategy game where you have to summon your troops on the fly, and manage both the troops and your turn order in order to defeat your opponent's army.
project_description: This project was created for a 3 month long school project. We were to use DigiPen's In-House Graphics Engine (Alpha Engine) and C++ in order to make a 2D game. We also made a level editor, to allow for quick iteration of levels, and prototyping various attacks and mechanics. 
job_details: 
- Took care of managing the game design document, along with conducting playtests (both physical and digital) within the team and outside of the team.
- Balanced all the unit parameters against each other, along with their attacks and costs.
- Created and implemented the Turn Order system, in which each unit's attacks will affect when their next turn is, and some units can unleash attacks on areas after a period of time.
- Implemented the UI system and cutscene system for the game.
- Created a level editor for the team using Windows Forms in C#, which is able to save and load levels.
- Created and implemented all attacks in the game, and liaisoned with the artist and producer in order to ensure that the graphics matched the required experience.
