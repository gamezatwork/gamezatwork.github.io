project_summary: |
  Moving On is a Puzzle Adventure game where you have to traverse a colourless world by painting it with colours, in order to discover the secret behind that world, reach home, and finally move on.  
  Your character will always be moving forward, and can only cross coloured areas, but you control the character's direction, and you are able to colour (or uncolour) areas on the map using a limited supply of energy.

  This project was created as an entry to the DBS Game Jam 2014 under the theme of "Life" and "Loss", and had to be made within 3 days. All assets, from graphics, to sounds, to scripts, were created from scratch within that time.  
  We were able to win the Grand Prize amongst more than 30 other competitors from other Singapore schools nationwide.
